## ✨ Project Description ✨
This apartment management system manages user registration, login, and logout operations. The project is divided into admin and user panels. The admin panel includes features such as user and apartment management, role management, and viewing communication messages. The user panel allows users to view their assigned dues, make payments, and send messages to administrators. The project also includes fundamental features such as the Identity system, role-based authorization, and session management.
